This page provides an overview of the workshops and training modules that are maintained by the group. Each workshop repositories and its corresponding training modules are described in detail below.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo get started on how to reuse existing BTP workshops or developing new workshops, please visit the [BTP Workshop Template][btp-workshop-template] page on GitHub. To know how the BTP images and instances are created and launched, please visit the [BTP Orchestration][btp-orchestration] page on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## [Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing Hands-on Workshop][btp-workshop-ngs]\r\n\r\nThis is a practical 3 day hands-on course designed for bench biologists, PhD students or early career postdoctoral researchers with no or basic bioinformatics experience who are planning or currently using NGS approaches in their research area. It will include a half-day introduction to the command line interface.\r\n\r\n| Training Modules                                 |\r\n|:-------------------------------------------------|\r\n| [Data Quality][btp-module-ngs-qc]                |\r\n| [Read Alignment][btp-module-ngs-mapping]         |\r\n| [ChIP-Seq][btp-module-ngs-chipseq]               |\r\n| [RNA-Seq][btp-module-ngs-rnaseq]                 |\r\n| [de novo Genome Assembly][btp-module-ngs-denovo] |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nAll of these components, scripts and configuration tools make up the BTP and are managed and available on GitHub (https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops) and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.\r\n\r\n[btp-workshop-ngs]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs\r\n[btp-module-ngs-qc]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-qc\r\n[btp-module-ngs-mapping]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-mapping\r\n[btp-module-ngs-chipseq]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-chip-seq\r\n[btp-module-ngs-rnaseq]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-rna-seq\r\n[btp-module-ngs-denovo]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-velvet\r\n[btp-workshop-template]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-template#minting-a-doi-for-your-workshop\r\n[btp-orchestration]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration\r\n","google":"UA-68148892-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
