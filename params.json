It will include a half-day\r\nintroduction to the command line interface. The training modules \r\nincluded in this workshop are listed below:\r\n\r\n| Training Modules                                 |\r\n|:-------------------------------------------------|\r\n| [Data Quality][btp-module-ngs-qc]                |\r\n| [Read Alignment][btp-module-ngs-mapping]         |\r\n| [ChIP-Seq][btp-module-ngs-chipseq]               |\r\n| [RNA-Seq][btp-module-ngs-rnaseq]                 |\r\n| [de novo Genome Assembly][btp-module-ngs-denovo] |\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nThe `Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing Hands-on Workshop` image can be \r\nlaunched on the NeCTAR Research Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platforms.\r\nA detailed guide on launching the image on the NeCTAR Research Cloud \r\nis available [here][btp-orch-nectar-launch]. \r\nThe latest virtual machine on the NeCTAR Research Cloud is:\r\n\r\n| Name             | ID                                     |\r\n|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------|\r\n| `BTP-2016-01-25` | `9c7fd8ac-5cfe-4067-aae3-82e53a49def3` |\r\n \r\nA detailed guide for launching the image on AWS is also available [here][btp-orch-aws-launch]. \r\nOn AWS, the latest virtual machine image (AMI) is available on the following regions:\r\n\r\n| Region           | AMI            |\r\n|:-----------------|:---------------|\r\n| `ap-southeast-2` | `ami-be597ddd` |\r\n| `eu-west-1`      | `ami-d3a31ea0` |\r\n\r\nStand-alone virtual machine images are also available for VirtualBox and VMWare.\r\nThese are downloadable from [here][bpa-ngs-releases]. Once downloaded,\r\nit can be loaded straight into VirtualBox or VMWare.\r\n\r\nThe latest handouts for the `Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing Hands-on Workshop`\r\nare available [here][bpa-ngs-handouts].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nAll of these components, scripts and configuration tools make up the BTP and are managed and available on GitHub (https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops) and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.\r\n\r\n[btp-workshop-ngs]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs\r\n[btp-module-ngs-qc]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-qc\r\n[btp-module-ngs-mapping]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-mapping\r\n[btp-module-ngs-chipseq]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-chip-seq\r\n[btp-module-ngs-rnaseq]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-rna-seq\r\n[btp-module-ngs-denovo]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-velvet\r\n[btp-workshop-template]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-template#minting-a-doi-for-your-workshop\r\n[btp-orchestration]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration\r\n[btp-orch-nectar-launch]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration#nectar-1\r\n[btp-orch-aws-launch]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration#aws-1\r\n[bpa-workshops]: http://www.bioplatforms.com/training/\r\n[bpa-ngs-releases]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs/releases\r\n[bpa-ngs-handouts]: http://bpa-csiro-workshops.github.io/btp-workshop-ngs/\r\n","google":"UA-68148892-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
