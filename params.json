This page provides an overview of the workshops and training modules that are maintained by the group. Each workshop repositories and its corresponding training modules are described in detail below.\r\n\r\n## [Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing][btp-workshop-ngs]\r\n\r\nThis is a practical 3 day hands-on course designed for bench biologists, PhD students or early career postdoctoral researchers with no or basic bioinformatics experience who are planning or currently using NGS approaches in their research area. It will include a half-day introduction to the command line interface.\r\n\r\n## [Cancer Genomics][btp-workshop-cancer]\r\n\r\nThis is a practical 3 day hands-on course designed for cancer biologists, wet lab scientists and clinical researchers, which aims to provide an introduction to cancer genomics analytical pipelines for single nucleotide variation (SNV), copy number variation (CNV) and structural variation (SV).\r\n\r\n## [De novo Assembly][btp-workshop-denovo]\r\n\r\nThe de novo assembly workshop will provide an introduction to de novo assembly, with hands on exercises followed by in-depth analysis of the key steps in the process. It will cover aspects such as quality control and pre-processing of datasets, generation and evaluation of first pass assemblies, assembly improvement and scaffolding. Practical exercises will be performed on small-scale real datasets, and will include best practices.\r\n\r\n[btp-workshop-ngs]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs\r\n[btp-workshop-cancer]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-cancer\r\n[btp-workshop-denovo]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-denovo\r\n","google":"UA-68148892-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
