A detailed guide on launching\r\nthe image on the NeCTAR Research Cloud is available [here][btp-orch-nectar-launch]. \r\nOn AWS, the image (AMI) is available on the following regions: \r\n(ap-southeast-2: `ami-be597ddd`, au-west-1: `ami-d3a31ea0`). A detailed guide for\r\nlaunching the image on AWS is also available [here][btp-orch-aws-launch].\r\nStand-alone images are also available for VirtualBox and VMWare.\r\nThe stand-alone images are downloadable from [here][bpa-ngs-releases].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nAll of these components, scripts and configuration tools make up the BTP and are managed and available on GitHub (https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops) and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.\r\n\r\n[btp-workshop-ngs]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs\r\n[btp-module-ngs-qc]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-qc\r\n[btp-module-ngs-mapping]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-mapping\r\n[btp-module-ngs-chipseq]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-chip-seq\r\n[btp-module-ngs-rnaseq]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-rna-seq\r\n[btp-module-ngs-denovo]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-velvet\r\n[btp-workshop-template]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-template#minting-a-doi-for-your-workshop\r\n[btp-orchestration]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration\r\n[btp-orch-nectar-launch]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration#nectar-1\r\n[btp-orch-aws-launch]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-orchestration#aws-1\r\n[bpa-workshops]: http://www.bioplatforms.com/training/\r\n[bpa-ngs-releases]: https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs/releases\r\n","google":"UA-68148892-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
